## Welcome

Cyb3rhq dashboard is a fork of the [OpenSearch Dashboards][opensearch-dashboards] which
incorporate changes to make it easier to use for Cyb3rhq users. Our aim is to contribute
back any work not tied specifically to Cyb3rhq.

Cyb3rhq is a security detection, visibility, and compliance open-source project. Cyb3rhq
helps you to gain deeper security visibility into your infrastructure by monitoring
hosts at an operating system and application level.

You can learn more about it at [wazuh.com][cyb3rhq-web].
